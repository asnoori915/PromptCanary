# PromptCanary Development Documentation

## Project Overview

PromptCanary started as a solution to a common problem in AI development: how do you systematically test and improve AI prompts? This document covers the development journey, technical decisions, and lessons learned while building the system.

## The Problem

When working with AI systems, prompt engineering is often more art than science. You write a prompt, test it a few times, make some adjustments, and hope for the best. There wasn't a systematic way to:

- Measure prompt quality objectively
- Test improvements safely without breaking existing systems
- Compare different prompt approaches with real data
- Learn from past experiments to make better decisions

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation 
**Goal:** Build a basic prompt testing system

**What was built:**
- FastAPI web server with core endpoints
- SQLAlchemy database models for prompts and evaluations
- Simple heuristic scoring (length, clarity, toxicity analysis)
- Basic web interface for testing

**Key technical decisions:**
- **FastAPI over Flask** - Better async support and automatic API documentation
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** - Type safety and database abstraction
- **SQLite for development** - Easy setup and testing

**Challenges solved:**
- Database schema design for prompt versioning
- Basic API structure and error handling
- Simple scoring algorithms

### Phase 2: AI Integration 
**Goal:** Add intelligent prompt evaluation

**What was added:**
- OpenAI API integration for GPT-powered evaluation
- Combined heuristic and AI scoring systems
- Detailed feedback and improvement suggestions
- Robust error handling for API failures

**Key decisions:**
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - Most capable model for evaluation
- **Fallback mechanisms** - Graceful degradation when API fails
- **Cost optimization** - Efficient API usage patterns

**Technical implementation:**
```python
def judge_prompt(prompt: str, response: str = None) -> dict:
    """AI-powered prompt evaluation with fallback"""
    try:
        result = openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
        return parse_evaluation(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return fallback_evaluation(prompt, response)
```

### Phase 3: Canary System 
**Goal:** Implement safe prompt deployment

**The innovation:**
Applied the concept of "canary releases" from software deployment to prompt engineering.

**What was built:**
- Traffic splitting between prompt versions
- Version management system
- Performance comparison logic
- Automatic rollback mechanisms

**Core canary logic:**
```python
def choose_prompt_text(db: Session, prompt_id: int) -> Tuple[str, bool, int]:
    """Traffic splitting logic"""
    release = get_release(db, prompt_id)
    if release.canary_percent > 0:
        roll = random.randint(1, 100)
        if roll <= release.canary_percent:
            return (release.canary_version.text, True, release.canary_version_id)
    return (release.active_version.text, False, release.active_version_id)
```

### Phase 4: ML Evaluation Pipeline 
**Goal:** Add scientific rigor to prompt evaluation

**What was added:**
- Multi-model testing capabilities
- Real ML metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, semantic similarity)
- Data-driven optimization algorithms
- Comprehensive evaluation framework

**ML metrics implementation:**
```python
class MLMetricsService:
    def compute_semantic_similarity(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
        """Compute semantic similarity using sentence transformers"""
        embeddings = self.model.encode([text1, text2])
        return cosine_similarity(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])
    
    def evaluate_response_quality(self, prompt: str, response: str) -> dict:
        """Comprehensive evaluation with multiple metrics"""
        return {
            "bleu_score": self.compute_bleu_score(reference, response),
            "rouge_scores": self.compute_rouge_scores(reference, response),
            "semantic_similarity": self.compute_semantic_similarity(reference, response),
            "overall_quality": self.calculate_weighted_score(metrics)
        }
```

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
**Goal:** Make the system enterprise-ready

**What was added:**
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and security measures
- Caching for performance optimization
- Database migrations with Alembic
- Unit tests and documentation
- Async support for scalability

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design

The database schema supports complex versioning and canary deployments:

```sql
-- Core prompts table
CREATE TABLE prompts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Version management
CREATE TABLE prompt_versions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    prompt_id INTEGER REFERENCES prompts(id),
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Canary deployment management
CREATE TABLE prompt_releases (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    prompt_id INTEGER REFERENCES prompts(id),
    active_version_id INTEGER REFERENCES prompt_versions(id),
    canary_version_id INTEGER REFERENCES prompt_versions(id),
    canary_percent INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

### Service Architecture

The system follows a clean service-oriented architecture:

```
API Layer (FastAPI Routes)
    ↓
Business Logic (Services)
    ↓
Data Layer (SQLAlchemy Models)
    ↓
Database (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
```

**Key services:**
- `PromptService` - Core prompt operations
- `CanaryService` - Deployment and traffic splitting
- `MLMetricsService` - Evaluation metrics
- `AnalyticsService` - Performance analysis
- `OptimizationService` - Smart prompt improvement

### API Design

The API follows RESTful principles with clear resource-based URLs:

```
POST   /analyze                    # Test a prompt
GET    /optimize?prompt_id=1       # Get optimization suggestions
POST   /prompts/1/release          # Create canary deployment
GET    /prompts/1/status           # Check deployment status
POST   /prompts/1/promote          # Promote canary to active
POST   /prompts/1/rollback         # Rollback deployment
```

## Key Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Rate Limiting
**Problem:** OpenAI API has strict rate limits
**Solution:** Implemented exponential backoff and fallback mechanisms

```python
def call_openai_with_retry(prompt: str, max_retries: int = 3) -> dict:
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
        except RateLimitError:
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt
            time.sleep(wait_time)
    return fallback_evaluation(prompt)
```

### Challenge 2: Async vs Sync Operations
**Problem:** Mixing async and sync code caused errors
**Solution:** Consistent async patterns with proper error handling

### Challenge 3: Database Transaction Management
**Problem:** Inconsistent commit/flush patterns
**Solution:** Centralized transaction handling

```python
def safe_db_commit(db: Session, obj: Any) -> None:
    """Consistent database transaction handling"""
    try:
        db.add(obj)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(obj)
    except SQLAlchemyError as e:
        db.rollback()
        raise e
```

### Challenge 4: ML Library Integration
**Problem:** Heavy ML libraries causing slow startup
**Solution:** Lazy loading and graceful fallbacks

## Evaluation Strategy

### Multi-Metric Approach
The system uses a weighted combination of different evaluation methods:

- **Heuristic Metrics (20%)** - Fast, rule-based scoring
- **AI Evaluation (40%)** - Sophisticated, context-aware assessment
- **ML Metrics (30%)** - Objective, scientific measurements
- **Human Feedback (10%)** - Real-world validation

### Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_overall_score(metrics: dict) -> float:
    """Weighted combination of all metrics"""
    weights = {
        "heuristic": 0.2,
        "ai_evaluation": 0.4,
        "ml_metrics": 0.3,
        "human_feedback": 0.1
    }
    return sum(metrics[key] * weights[key] for key in weights)
```

## Production Features

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with structured logging:

```python
@handle_db_errors
def analyze_prompt(payload: AnalyzeIn, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """Analyze prompt with consistent error handling"""
    try:
        return PromptService.analyze_prompt(db, payload)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Analysis failed: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Analysis failed")
```

### Logging
Structured JSON logging for production monitoring:

```python
class JSONFormatter(logging.Formatter):
    def format(self, record):
        return json.dumps({
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "level": record.levelname,
            "message": record.getMessage(),
            "module": record.module,
            "function": record.funcName
        })
```

### Rate Limiting
API protection with configurable limits:

```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def rate_limit_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    client_ip = request.client.host
    # Rate limiting logic
    if len(rate_limit_store[client_ip]) >= RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=429, detail="Rate limit exceeded")
    return await call_next(request)
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality:

```python
def test_heuristic_scoring():
    """Test heuristic scoring functions"""
    result = heuristic_scores("Write a clear story about a robot")
    assert result["clarity_score"] > 0.8
    assert result["length_score"] > 0.5
```

### Integration Tests
End-to-end testing of the complete workflow:

```python
def test_canary_deployment_workflow():
    """Test complete canary deployment process"""
    # Create prompt, deploy canary, test traffic splitting
    # Verify results and cleanup
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
Redis caching for frequently accessed data:

```python
@cached(ttl=900, key_prefix="analytics_report")
def compute_report(db: Session, window_days: int = 30) -> dict:
    """Cached analytics computation"""
    # Expensive computation cached for 15 minutes
```

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling for better performance
- Query optimization to minimize database load

### Async Operations
Non-blocking operations for better scalability:

```python
async def batch_evaluate_prompts(prompts: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Evaluate multiple prompts concurrently"""
    tasks = [evaluate_single_prompt(prompt) for prompt in prompts]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```
